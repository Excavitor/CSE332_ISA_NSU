Here we build a 14-bit ISA circuit using Logisim. 
we use 19 instruction and everything works perfectly.
You will find "Text Document" in every folder to help you understand/run easily.
You can see,
	14-bit ISA Design in Final Datapath folder.
	"datapath.circ" -> Logisim File (inside Datapath folder) also giving "Text Document".
	14-bit assembler file in Assembler Folder(word file) + python file(assembler design code) + "Information".

Sequence:
	1. First understand ISA design file(word file).
	2. Then understand Assembler file(word file).
	3. Then see Assembly code(python file).
	4. At last Enter Datapath circuit(Logisim file).

NOTE: Always see "text document" file to understand that part in every folder.
